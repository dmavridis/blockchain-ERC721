# ERC721 NFT Capstone Project 

### Structure

Three major contracts are involved in the implementation of the Dapp, namely `ERC721Mintable.sol`, `Verifier.sol`, `SonlSquareVerifier.sol`. Other supportive contacts are also involved, mainly from the `OpenZeppellin` package. 

The top level contract is the `SonlSquareVerifier.sol` which extends the `ERC721Mintable.sol` contract and is using an inteface to the `Verifier.sol` cpntract, that is generated by Zokrates.

### Tips

To run the test, ganache is invoked using the following commands (mnemonic words are not required)

```
ganache-cli -p 8545 -m 'candy maple cake sugar pudding cream honey rich smooth crumble sweet treat' -a 20
```

Those mnemonic words are not the same as the ones used for to interact through Metamask with the deployed contract on Rinkeby.

For the installation of the packages, user needs to run `npm run`

### Running Zokrates

Zokrates is invoked in docker with the following command. Replace the `<absolute path>`with your path to the project. 

```
docker run -v <absolute path>\Blockchain-Capstone\zokrates\code:/home/zokrates/cod
e  -ti zokrates/zokrates /bin/bash
```

Compile the program written in ZoKrates DSL

```
../../zokrates compile -i square.code
```

```
 ../../zokrates setup --proving-scheme pghr13
```

```
~/zokrates compute-witness -a 3 9 
```

```
~/zokrates generate-proof --proving-scheme pghr13
```

```
~/zokrates export-verifier --proving-scheme pghr13
```

### Testing

There are three files used for testing.  Running

```
truffle test
```

produces the following output:

```
 Contract: TestERC721Mintable
    match erc721 spec
      √ should return total supply (57ms)
      √ should get token balance (69ms)
      √ should return token uri (82ms)
      √ should transfer token from one owner to another (317ms)
another (317ms)
    have ownership properties                    not contract owner (99ms)
      √ should fail when minting when address is not contract owner (99ms)
      √ should return contract owner (44ms)

  Contract: TestSolnSquareVerifier
    Mint with square verifier                   ng (228ms)
      √ Verifying minting (3608ms)
      √ Should fail when minting without verifying (228ms)

  Contract: TestSquareVerifier
    Verify Tx
      √ Correct verification (3312ms)


  9 passing (23s)    
```

### Deployment to Rinkeby

In order to deploy to Rinkeby test network, the `truffle-config.js` file has been appropriately modified. Infura key is: `533aeb9e6d1540f5b1825366fde32f23`. Then executing the command:

```
truffle migrate --reset --network
```

logs the output: 

```

### Transactions and OpenSea listing

Ten minting transaction are taking place, using the MyEtherWallet tool with Metamask. The abi is saved in the `abi.json` file. 

In OpenSea, the marketplace is located in:

https://rinkeby.opensea.io/assets/HomeToken

Ten items with tokenIds `1001-1010` are minted and the item `1005` is put into sale and a transaction is taking place and owner changes.
